            From 12 to 15 August, the spectacular scenery of the Rocce Rosse di Arbatax hosts the first edition
            of the Arabax Music Festival.

            Four evenings of music and entertainment, with a line up ready to make people sing and dance
            the public until dawn.

            Friday 12 will take the stage Afrojack, DJ and 'star' of EDM, Elettra Lamborghini and Lost Frequencies,
            Belgian producer with half a billion streams, on his first Italian date.

            Saturday 13, the crowds in front of the monumental red 'cathedral' on the Ogliastra sea are unleashed by the
            eagerly awaited Ghali and Achille Lauro.

            Sunday 14 Albertino, Fargetta, Molella and Prezioso make their return to the Island with their DeeJay Time
            Adventure Tour.

            Mid-August will be marked by rap with one of the leading names on the Italian scene: Gue Pequeno.

            But what will be remembered as one of the most important music evenings of the summer season in
            Sardinia, will host world rap legend 50 Cent, for his only date in Italy.

            With more than 50 million monthly streams on Spotify, 50 Cent who recently performed at the Super Bowl
            2022, will be the absolute protagonist of the last day of the Arabax Music Festival.

            On every day of appointments, the fun begins in the early afternoon, with the novelty of
            pre-festival: artist sessions and contests to entertain the public until the enchanting sunset on the
            red rocks.

            At the end of the show, DJ sets of electronic and dance music take turns to dance until dawn
            Sun.

            For the entire duration of the festival, there will be spaces dedicated to merchandise and refreshments in
            the area.
